<h1>Mother Nature</h1>
<p>Nature always wears the colors of the spirit</p>
<p>The Earth has music for those who listen.</p>
<p>Look deep into nature and then you will understand everything better</p>
<p>To walk in nature is to witness a thousand miracles</p>
<p>The Earth laughs in flowers</p>
<p>Nature is the art of God</p>
